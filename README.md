#Real Estate Project Description

RimAgency is a comprehensive real estate management platform designed to streamline property listing, management, and client interactions. The project is divided into two distinct spaces: the Admin Space for managing properties and user inquiries, and the Client Space for browsing and exploring available properties.

Admin Space
The Admin Space provides a secure and robust dashboard for administrators to manage the real estate platform efficiently. Access is protected by a dedicated login page with hard-coded credentials (admin_auth.php), ensuring only authorized users can manage the system. Key features include:

Property Management: Admins can add, edit, and delete property listings (add_property.php, edit_property.php, delete_property.php, list_properties.php), with details such as category, type, price, area, location, and photos.
Statistics Dashboard: Displays key metrics like total properties, properties by category, and properties by price range (statistics.php), helping admins analyze trends.
Message Management: Admins can view and manage user inquiries submitted via the contact form (view_messages.php), with details including full name, phone, message, and date sent.
Modern Design: Features a clean, responsive interface with a styled sidebar navigation, sticky footer, and dynamic JavaScript effects (fade-in animations, hover effects, button animations) for an enhanced user experience.
Client Space
The Client Space is designed for users to explore and interact with available properties seamlessly. Key features include:

Property Listings: Users can browse properties with detailed views (property_details.php), including a carousel of photos, property details (category, type, price, area, location, description, phone number), and a user-friendly layout.
Search Functionality: Allows users to search properties by location, type, category, and price range (search.php), making it easy to find properties that match their needs.
Contact Form: Clients can submit inquiries directly to the admin (contact.php), with messages stored for admin review.
Responsive Design: Ensures a seamless experience across devices, with a sticky footer, consistent typography, and a visually appealing carousel for property images.
Overall Features
Unified Theme: Both spaces use a consistent design with a light beige background (#F5EEDC), dark blue-gray headings (#183B4E), and golden yellow accents (#DDA853), creating a cohesive user experience.
Security: Includes basic security measures like data sanitization (htmlspecialchars()) to prevent XSS vulnerabilities and admin authentication with hard-coded credentials for the Admin Space.
Database Integration: Utilizes a MySQL database (db_connection.php) to store properties, photos, and contact messages, ensuring efficient data management.
RimAgency is a full-stack PHP project with Bootstrap for responsive design, JavaScript for dynamic effects, and a clean, modern aesthetic, making it an ideal solution for real estate agencies looking to manage listings and engage with clients effectively.
